# Matrix
Matrix is a dual-dimensional data structure with a easy to use and smart implementation to use it with array operators and debug tools like dumping objects.

The idea comes from returning dual-dimensional arrays from functions that is a boring proccess. Matrix also has key, value feature to prevent using maps for some needings. This data structure is more likely to database tables and it can be used to storing data on ram.

## Installation and configure
Installation and configure is pretty easy just clone header file located in `dist/Matrix.h` and add it to your project like:

`#include "matrix.h"`
